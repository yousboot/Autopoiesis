Following the framework we precised on README.md, we need to rebuild everything from the ground up. 
Below is the exhaustive list of exercices that, if followed correctly, would lead to a compelete understanding of all the aspects of computer science.

1. Using only **(OR, NOT)**, deduce the other logical operators (AND, XOR, ...)
2. Know **Morgan Law**
3. Draw logic gates using *(switches-wires-generator-bulb) only* for all logical operators
4. Draw arithmetic operations circuits (ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV) using (switches-wires-generator-bulb) only.
5. Draw schema for 4 digit binary calculator using (switches-wires-generator-bulb) only.
6. Simplify calculator schema to use Gates & Latches & Adders.
