# Autopoiesis
Autopoiesis is a repo that record my process of *reindexing* all computer science knowledge in my mind, by reiterating over the basics and understanding the small nuances that we tend to forget. 

## BBB Framework:
To **become** something, **break** it apart and then **build** up.
And so to become a CS engineer, we will break all the part into tiny parts that make sense, then rebuild them together. This way we understand every component and how it fits in the whole picture.


## Genesis:
A computer  : **Machine that is capable of computation.**
Computation : **A set of arithmetic calculations to solve a problem on a Turing Machine.**
Calculation : **Mathematical process that transforms one or more inputs into one or more outputs or results.**
Turing Machine : **A finite automaton that reads instruction symbols from an infinitely long tape with 4 states : Move left, Move right, Read value, Write value.**
Finite automaton : **It is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time.**


This repository is structured as follows: 
* Quick Reference Sheets    : Containing cheat sheets
* Books : Practical books that are important to read
* Utils : Important files that we need on a regular basis
